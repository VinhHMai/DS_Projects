Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = Primary_key (id): 10000
ii. Hours = Foreign_key (business_id): 1562
iii. Category = Foreign_key (business_id): 2643
iv. Attribute = Foreign_key (business_id): 1115
v. Review = Primary_key (id): 10000
			Foreign_key (business_id): 8090
			Foreign_key (user_id): 9581
vi. Checkin = Foreign_key (business_id): 493
vii. Photo = Primary_key (id): 10000
			Foreign_key (business_id): 6493
viii. Tip = Foreign_key (business_id): 3979
			Foreign_key (user_id): 537
ix. User = Primary_key (id): 10000
x. Friend = Foreign_key (user_id): 11
xi. Elite_years = Foreign_key (user_id): 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

After looking through the tables, I decided on the the category of restaurants in the city of Toronto. Toronto has restaurants 
that have a range of star ratings from 1-5. 

+-------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| stars | name        | review_count | hours                 | city    | category    | neighborhood           |

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, restaurants such as Sushi Osaka are open everyday, generally from 11:00-23:00 and other restaurants such as Edulis have hours ranging from
18:00-23:00 Wednesday to Sunday.   

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
The highest rated restaurant, Sushi Osaka, only has 8 reviews; while restaurants like Pizzaiolo have a rating of 3.0 with 34 reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Popular destinations such as Niagara and Entertainment District seem to have higher review_counts than restaurants in neighborhoods such as 
Etobicoke. That being said, there is not enough data to determine if the locations of the restaurants correlate with their ratings. 

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
        b.stars,
        b.name,
        b.review_count,
        h.hours,
        b.city,
        c.category,
        b.neighborhood

FROM 
        business b
        JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
        JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE 
        b.stars >= 2
        AND b.city = 'Toronto'
        AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
ORDER BY b.stars DESC, b.name DESC, h.hours DESC;
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones 
that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+---------+
| NumOfBusinesses | AveNumOfReviews | AveStarRating | is_open |
+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+---------+
|            1520 |            23.2 |          3.52 |       0 |
|            8480 |           31.76 |          3.68 |       1 |
+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+---------+
		
i. Difference 1:

There are 1520 businesses that are closed, compared to 8480 businesses that are open.

ii. Difference 2:
         
 The average number of reviews for closed businesses 23.2 reviews at an average rating of 3.52 stars. For open businesses, there are 31.76 
 average number of reviews with an average rating of 3.68 stars.
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS NumOfBusinesses,
        ROUND(AVG(review_count), 2) AS AveNumOfReviews,
	ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS AveStarRating,
	is_open

FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset 
and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find 
commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user 
will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own 
problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

For this analysis, I have chosen to conduct sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews. Specifically, I will be parsing out keywords and 
business attributes from the reviews to analyze sentiment. This analysis aims to understand the sentiment of customers towards different 
businesses based on their reviews.    
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

To perform sentiment analysis, I will need the following data:
Yelp reviews data, including the review text and corresponding star ratings.
Business attributes, such as category, location, and other relevant business information.
User information to potentially analyze the sentiment and preferences of different user groups.
I chose this data because it allows me to analyze the sentiment of Yelp reviews, understand the factors that influence customer sentiment, 
and potentially provide insights to businesses on how to improve their services or products.
                        
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

The finished dataset will include the following columns:
-Review Text
-Star Rating
-Business Category
-Location
-User Information (optional, if needed for analysis)
-Sentiment Score (output of sentiment analysis)
-The sentiment score will be assigned to each review to quantify the sentiment as a numerical value, making it easier to perform quantitative 
analysis.
      
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

Here is an example SQL code to create the final dataset by joining relevant tables and calculating sentiment scores using a sentiment analysis tool:

SELECT
        r.user_id,
        r.stars AS star_rating,
        c.category AS business_category,
        b.city || ', ' || b.state || ' ' || b.postal_code AS location,
        r.text AS review_text
FROM
        review r
JOIN
        business b ON r.business_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN

| n-Hit0Y3O6FxTiEhdEEsZw |           1 |              None | North Las Vegas, NV 89030 | Came on Valentine's Day night having pre-bought tickets. We ended up waiting in line for over ten minutes (missing the beginning of our movie) because all of their automated ticketing machines were broken and they weren't properly staffed at the ticket counters. Just to pick up tickets that we had already bought!!! Seriously annoying from a theater that usually is so enjoyable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Our NYE at home featured pizza and tiki drinks. My bf called for take-out (I figured it would be at least an hour wait), and they told him 20 minutes, nice! It wasn't hard to find, though definitely not in a well-traveled area. Actually, had it been across Rio Salado in the Tempe Marketplace, we would not have tried it, because I HATE HATE HATE Tempe Marketplace, but that's another story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I've known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn't have found on my own online was the prescriptions. |

Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they'd requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I'd wasted two hours of my time and another doctor's bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you're not on vacation when they send the bill!                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I'd successfully broken up with my doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn't want to deal with it anymore. There's plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn't that interested in improving their business- so I'll just take mine elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

All of the credit has to go Jonathan and the great business he has going with Kimberfire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

I couldn't recommend buying your engagement ring at Kimberfire highly enough. My only advice would be that if you need to wait 8 or so weeks for a consultation, don't be intimidated - lock it in straight away! The wait is totally worth it to find something she'll be in love with wearing for the rest of her life!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dh3xOLJZNW97jYjy8au89A |           4 |              None | Phoenix, AZ 85085         | I love coming here! I came in today after being gone for months and both Julie and Jessica greeted me and remembered exactly how I like my nails. I always do the herbal healthy gel because I'm allergic to led/uv gel lights and liquid acrylic monomer. I've only had one negative experience here which I'll include a photo of, but they quickly and pleasantly fixed it within just a few days of my original appointment. This salon is amazing and smells great, no smell of nail glue or chemicals because they don't use any chemicals. The prices are higher but for someone who is allergic to all traditional nail products, the added cost is worth it for me. Especially the friendly experience!! A full set with the herbal gel (acrylic dip powder sans liquid monomer) is $45 so not too terrible. Keep in mind in asking for a shape other than square or round there is a $7 charge for shaping [so coffin, stiletto, flare will cost you a bit more].                                                                   |

It's a lot more affordable than other ayce places which will cost me (+ tip) around $30 for dinner. The meat and banchans are pretty good, not crappy at all. They do lack desserts but so does Sura. I guess desserts aren't highlighted in Korean BBQ because people are too stuffed with meat and ran out of room for anything sweet afterwards. Everything they serve on the buffet may not be an A+... maybe a B-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

They also serve seafood such as shrimp and squid. They have all sorts of "salads" or cold dishes, along side other appetizers? Such as pot stickers and grilled fish. They also serve sushi rolls but I never give those any attention. If I want to eat sushi, ayce Korean BBQ (or any buffet in general) ain't the place. I go to ayce sushi joints for that. They serve rose tea and I'm addicted to it.

| 2ivYtkXqCQeAfXEw33tEQQ |           2 |              None | Toronto, ON M3C 1J3       | This hotel was ok, but frankly, left a lot to be desired. The staff were very nice, and while I didn't try the restaurant, it looked nice too. However, as soon as I got to my floor, i noticed trash on the floors in hallways, like housekeeping spilled some and didn't clean it up. I caught that twice during my stay. The safety latch on my door was broken. As was the ice machine. The gym is next to the pool, and is open air, which means it stinks of chlorine. I knew staying in there with that strong of a smell was going to trigger a migraine, so I didn't get to use the gym at all. Lastly, room service uses a cell phone and disconnects easily- it shouldn't be THAT difficult for me to place an order, but it was. Once it arrived, the food was good, but it was a real pain to get to that point. I don't see myself staying here again- the changes needed are all minor and can really improve the hotel.                                                                                                       |

Switch's Fried Toast is a common item for such a craving.  It's very delicious and flavorful, crispy on the outside and soggy in the inside.

She told me the pistachio one was hand grind nuts and no artificial color added( loved it) but my favorite flavor is still the rich salted caramel. Bf ordered grapefruit and mango sorbet on a chocolate cookie cone ( as my request). Not so sweet; just perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished.

There was not a lot of seating in the restaurant however it seems like there was enough room to add at least 5 more tables. I feel like they are not utilizing the space to its fullist potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Rounded up to three stars because of the business hours.  All the usual suspects on the menu so no surprises there.  The BBQ and noodle dishes are not be as good as other places, but they get a pass because they stay open way late.  So really the main reason to come here is because most of the better HK places have already closed; and if it's that late at night, chances are you'll be pretty drunk so the food will be perfectly acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Their fries are great too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| HDO6J5DrptQMjC0iccV1Ig |           5 |              None | Las Vegas, NV 89147       | Love this place!! I'm new to the area and was invited by friends and thought why not! The menu has a wide variety including vegan items- I am not vegan but for some reason decided to order from the "vegan side" of the menu. The chicken lettuce cups were delicious!! Service was fast, friendly staff and kick ass cucumber water that's freeeeee! The banana split smoothie is the jam by the way. So happy I found a healthy place so close to me! Worth satin again that the staff was really nice and they all had smiles on their faces!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
